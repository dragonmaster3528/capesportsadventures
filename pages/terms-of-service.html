                    </ul>
                    <p>If we cancel for reasons other than non-payment or conduct, you will receive a full refund or the option to rebook.</p>

                    <h2>6. Changes and Amendments</h2>

                    <h2>8. Health, Fitness, and Safety</h2>
                    <p>Some activities require a reasonable level of fitness or have age/health restrictions. You are responsible for:</p>

                    <h2>9. Liability</h2>
                    <p>We act as an agent for third-party service providers. While we carefully select our partners, we are not liable for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Acts, omissions, or negligence of third-party suppliers</li>
                        <li>Injury, illness, death, loss, or damage arising from your travel</li>

                        <li>Loss or theft of personal belongings</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our liability, where applicable, is limited to the cost of the services we directly provided. Nothing in these terms excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or fraud.</p>

                    <p>In such events, we will work with you to reschedule or provide credit for future travel. Refunds will depend on what we can recover from suppliers.</p>

                    <h2>11. Complaints</h2>
